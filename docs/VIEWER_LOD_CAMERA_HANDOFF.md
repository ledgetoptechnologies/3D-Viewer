# Viewer LOD and camera investigation handoff

## 2026-08-30 authenticated complete-coverage fix

The authenticated church hierarchy proved the remaining blank-space problem was
startup order, foreground priority, and replacement-branch headroom:

- Detail 13 selected all 256 zero-error leaves before any complete coarse
  frontier had been established.
- SSE-first queue ordering loaded farther positive-error intermediate content
  ahead of nearby zero-error leaves.
- The complete 16-tile coarse frontier consumed about 1.27 GiB decoded, leaving
  too little of the ordinary 1.75 GiB ceiling to finish a foreground REPLACE
  branch before its parent could be replaced.

The Viewer now loads one renderable root overview, replaces it only after a
complete coarse frontier is attached and queues settle, and captures that
frontier for narrow LRU retention. Steady Detail 16 advances one bounded LOD
step beyond the measured coarse target instead of staying equal to it or
selecting the entire zero-error hierarchy. On the church this changes the
steady target from 1,024 to 512. Captured overview tiles are also registered as
scoped `REPLACE` fallbacks, allowing a previously inactive coarse branch to
cover a camera return while its descendants continue loading. This does not set
`loadAncestors` or pin unrelated paths. Queue priority remains used/in-frustum,
then nearest camera distance. Large measured overview frontiers receive bounded
branch-completion headroom up to 3 GiB; small models remain at 1.75 GiB and
reduced-memory clients settle on the complete root under the existing 768 MiB
cap. Sibling preloads, automatic global detail rollback, root `ADD`, and
overlapping coarse rendering remain disabled.

The final local bundle was run against the protected production church assets.
All 48 sampled bootstrap, unchanged-close, orbit, and return frames retained
structural coverage. Startup attached 16/16 coarse tiles. An unchanged close
view rendered 12 depth-3 fine leaves within 30 seconds at Detail 16. Return
maintained immediate complete coverage using captured coarse fallbacks while
intermediate replacements kept streaming, and no runtime exceptions occurred.
A forced 4 GiB run retained complete root coverage in every frame. It remained
root-only because the church's required replacement frontier is larger than the
768 MiB reduced cache; the affected desktop browser followed the normal
`coarse-coverage-ready` path rather than this reduced path.

## 2026-08-30 local item-admission reproduction

Commit `7c0639c` was reproduced in a real headless browser with a generated
64-leaf, eight-branch B3DM hierarchy served through the authenticated-session
URL shape. At a close Detail 16 pose, the 48-item cache ceiling stopped
admission even though decoded content used only about 9 KiB against the
1.75 GiB byte ceiling. All queues were idle, the cache contained 48 used items,
16 selected leaves remained pending, and only 40 of 56 selected leaves were
attached. A tiny camera move did not recover the missing branches. This matches
the production report that high detail appears nearby while only part of the
model completes.

The local fix raises only the desktop item-count failsafe from 48 to 1,024.
The 0.4 GiB warm byte floor, 1.75 GiB hard byte ceiling, eight-item warm floor,
20-percent unload pass, `loadAncestors = false`, strict `REPLACE` traversal,
and camera-driven screen-space-error target remain unchanged. With that one
change, the same close Detail 16 pose settled with all 56 selected leaves
attached and zero pending tiles. A wide zoom-out evicted back to nine cache
items and eight coarse visible branches; returning close restored all 56
selected leaves without a global quality reset.

This proves item-count admission was independently capable of producing the
partial model. The authenticated production church dataset remains the final
release gate because its real tile byte sizes and bounding volumes are not part
of the generated fixture.

## Status

**Root causes reproduced and fixed locally as of 2026-08-30; production remains
unconfirmed until the user tests the merged deployment.**

### 2026-08-30 angle, point-cloud overlay, and idle-session follow-up

The production church session proved the remaining angle failure was cache
admission, not bandwidth: a broken oblique pose showed 31 coarse visible tiles
at Detail 2, while a nearby good pose showed one Detail-16 tile. Renderer 0.5.1
was marking every loaded content-bearing ancestor on selected paths as LRU-used.
Wide views therefore pinned inactive coarse ancestors until a newly parsed
foreground tile hit the hard cache limit and was discarded before the
application's later `load-model` callback could make room.

The exact-version postinstall patch now releases loaded, non-active ancestors;
active REPLACE fallback parents remain pinned until their selected descendants
are ready. It also emits a synchronous `tile-memory-pressure` hook before the
discard and rechecks the hard cap afterward. The Viewer evicts one stale entry
at that hook. A memory-limited fallback can no longer overwrite the last truly
settled detail stage.

Potree camera coordinates were already correct. Markers disappeared over dense
points because Potree's EDL fullscreen composite ran after the ordinary scene
and overwrote them without sharing that scene's depth. Point-cloud markers now
live in a dedicated scene rendered from `render.pass.perspective_overlay`,
after Potree clears depth, with depth testing and writing disabled. Model-view
marker rendering is unchanged.

Long-idle failures were a renewal race plus an unrecoverable error path. Viewer
and workspace renewal now catch up on focus, visibility, pageshow, or an
authenticated tile failure. A fresh, exact one-time grant may extend the same
expired-but-unrevoked session and bearer in place; an expired bearer alone is
still rejected everywhere. Auth and transient tile failures retain the current
renderer and call `resetFailedTiles()` after recovery, while permanent decode,
manifest, and 4xx content failures still fail closed.

### 2026-08-29 near-cap recovery follow-up

The live signed-in church session reproduced `LOD: memory-limited Detail 2`
after Hermes's Detail-13/cache-retention release. That was not a bandwidth
limit: a first near-cap pose permanently latched `lodStarvedAtDetail`, the
startup code treated unverified Detail 2 as the last settled frontier, and
recovery set `minBytesSize = 0`. Because the renderer marks prior-view tiles
LRU-unused every frame, small camera motion during recovery then purged recent
decoded scenes and returning re-requested them.

The follow-up keeps the correct positive-infinite SSE priority and ancestor
fallback, but changes the governor as follows:

- the default request is Detail 16, staged through a complete Detail-13
  frontier instead of stopping at Detail 13;
- the last-settled frontier starts unknown and is recorded only after actual
  visible-target settlement, preventing an initial `13 → 2` collapse;
- the second blocked sample starts bounded admission recovery without changing
  quality; rollback is reserved for the fourth consecutive blocked sample;
- recovery frees only enough space for one stale LRU tile and never sets the
  byte floor to zero;
- completed foreground parses get the same synchronous stale-entry eviction
  chance before renderer 0.5.1's known full-cache discard path; and
- a stable fallback ceiling survives tiny movement, but a cumulative 20%
  zoom, 10% focus-relative translation, or 10-degree orbit clears it and
  restarts staged refinement for the new view.

Deterministic unit coverage now includes the exact 3.6 GiB/0.5 GiB pinned-tile
case, bounded eviction, delayed rollback, and pose thresholds. The
self-contained authenticated browser fixture proves automatic `13 → 16`
refinement without a slider event. The user's production verification remains
the release gate.

Production inspection on 2026-08-28 found that the hierarchy itself was
working, but the startup policy requested Detail 24 and immediately staged
through Detail 13. A cold default view consequently fetched the root and 240 of
241 LOD-0 payloads within 20 seconds; forcing Detail 2 before startup stabilized
at 29 payloads (root, 12 LOD-2, and 16 LOD-1) with no LOD-0 requests in that
measured pose. That conservative startup was released by Codex but was later
shown to suppress expected close-range refinement. That historical candidate started
at requested and active Detail 13; requests above 13 still use staged refinement
and the memory governor.

The released runtime passed its original repository and B3DM fixture gates, but
the user subsequently reported incomplete, transparent, or dark foreground
geometry at ground-level and oblique camera poses. A real Chromium reproduction
then showed the LOD phase stuck at `warmup`, with active Detail 13 of a requested
24, while distant tiles continued to load.

Earlier Codex work reproduced two independent blockers. First, a camera inside
a terminal leaf's bounding volume produces distance zero and infinite
screen-space error;
the warmup gate incorrectly treated that zero-error leaf as refinable and
unsatisfied forever. Second, the renderer's LRU fullness check includes entry
count as well as decoded bytes. The old 48-entry desktop limit and 24-entry
reduced limit could fill with visible tiles and retained `REPLACE` parents, so
new downloads were refused even while the byte budget still had room.

That work made a visible terminal zero-error leaf satisfy warmup at infinite
screen-space error, raised item-count headroom, and added a memory-pressure
governor. The 2026-08-28 candidate additionally changed the default to Detail 13,
raises the measured desktop byte profile to 3.25/3.5 GiB, retains recently
decoded LOD scenes across small motion, prioritizes positive-infinite SSE, and
temporarily relaxes only the LRU soft byte floor after confirmed starvation so
standard eviction can restore admission. All real-browser cases listed in the
candidate evidence below now pass on this Linux host. Treat the user's live
report as authoritative: local evidence is not a production confirmation, and
the issue must not be called resolved in the deployed Viewer until the user
verifies it.

### Gap-free staged refinement update

The user's next production test exposed a separate transition failure: the
Detail-2 overview was coherent, but a high-detail request could take a long
time to replace the focused church facade, and zooming back out left large
black holes. A live browser capture showed Detail 24 requesting a large LOD-0
frontier, then dropping through memory-limited detail levels while required
content remained absent. Returning to Detail 2 restored full coverage.

The failure matches the hard cache-admission livelock documented upstream in
[`3d-tiles-renderer` issue #1689](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/3DTilesRendererJS/issues/1689):
when the demanded used set fills the cache, no unused entry can be evicted, new
downloads are refused, and the queues can become idle with refinement
unfinished. The previous application governor detected only terminal LOD-0
leaves, waited three samples, and stepped down one Detail at a time. It could
therefore react late and visibly discard an incomplete frontier.

This update:

- enables standard `REPLACE` ancestor fallback so a ready coarse branch remains
  visible until its selected children are content-ready;
- exact-pins `3d-tiles-renderer` 0.5.1 and applies a fail-closed postinstall
  patch that separates ancestor fallback from off-frustum sibling preload;
- stages high-detail requests as `13 → 16 → 19 → 22 → requested`, advancing
  only after the current visible frontier and all queues settle;
- treats any selected in-frustum renderable tile—not only a terminal LOD-0
  leaf—as pending starvation work;
- on the second consecutive full-cache/idle-queue sample, returns directly to
  the last fully settled stage and records the failed stage as a
  non-oscillating ceiling; and
- exposes both selected-tile and terminal-leaf aggregate counts in sanitized
  LOD diagnostics.

The stretched brick pattern in the supplied close facade screenshot is not yet
proven to be a converter defect. A stalled intermediate tile can present the
same visual symptom. The schema-v3 audit proves UV presence and bounded spatial
equivalence, but it does not prove pixel-level equivalence after Obj2Tiles atlas
repacking. Do not enable Obj2Tiles `--keeptextures` as a speculative fix: the
documented representative run exceeded 157 GiB. First deploy this runtime fix
and compare the same facade only after diagnostics show a settled Detail-24
LOD-0 frontier. If distortion remains then, add a focused source-GLB versus
LOD-0 texture/UV audit rather than weakening the current production proof.

### Close-detail and small-motion retention update

After the gap-free staged-refinement merge, the user reported two remaining
symptoms: approaching the model did not load high resolution, and very small
orbit/pan/move inputs appeared to reset the cache.

The two user-reported behaviors were reproduced against the verified 33-tile
B3DM fixture. Source inspection also found a separate close-range priority
defect:

1. The released default was Detail 2 (`errorTarget = 512`). At the same close
   view, Detail 13 (`errorTarget = 32`) selected and attached six zero-error
   LOD-0 leaves without requesting global Detail 24.
2. That close frontier used `2,098,361,111` decoded bytes, but the desktop soft
   floor was only 0.4 GiB and 24 entries. `LRUCache.scheduleUnload()` runs every
   frame and unloads newly unused content toward those floors even when the hard
   cap is not full. A four-meter pan plus roughly one degree of orbit made one
   baseline leaf unused; its scene was immediately disposed even though the
   cache used only about 2.10 GB of its 3 GiB cap. Returning required a new scene
   and another request.
3. `screenSpaceErrorPriority()` treated every non-finite SSE as negative
   infinity. A refinable tile containing the camera has positive-infinite SSE,
   so the exact foreground branch could be sorted behind ordinary finite-error
   tiles. Positive infinity now receives highest error priority; malformed
   `NaN`, missing values, and negative infinity remain lowest.

The candidate fix:

- changes only the default request from Detail 2 to Detail 13;
- prioritizes a positive-infinite foreground SSE ahead of finite-error tiles;
- retains the existing staged path for explicit requests above 13;
- raises the desktop soft byte floor to 3.25 GiB and soft item floor to 512;
- raises the reduced-memory soft byte floor to 640 MiB and soft item floor to
  256;
- raises the desktop hard byte cap to 3.5 GiB because retained ancestor paths
  pushed the measured active working set above 3 GiB;
- leaves the reduced 768 MiB hard cap, 1,024/512 hard item caps, and 20-percent
  unload setting unchanged; and
- confirms memory starvation only after two consecutive one-second blocked
  samples, so the renderer's scheduled eviction gets one bounded chance to run.

The focused real-browser regression now reaches zero-error leaves by default,
crosses a nearby branch boundary with the same small movement, returns, and
observes identical scene UUIDs with no duplicate requests for the baseline
tiles. The final staged Detail-24 fixture run loaded all 16 LOD-0 leaves,
detached the coarse root, moved far, retained the decoded leaf scenes, and
returned without re-requesting them in about 83.2 seconds. Candidate evidence:

- focused LOD policy/material/runtime suite: 40 passed, 0 failed;
- full Node 24 suite: 468 passed, 0 failed/cancelled, 10 expected skips;
- close/small-motion real B3DM regression: passed in about 53.8 seconds;
- staged all-16-leaf close/far/return real B3DM regression: passed in about
  83.2 seconds;
- broader top-down/root-replacement/camera/diagnostics/tab-lifecycle real B3DM
  acceptance: passed in about 165.4 seconds;
- Docker production image build and rootless `568:568` runtime policy check:
  passed; and
- `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`: zero vulnerabilities.

Production remains unconfirmed until the user tests the published image.

## Released runtime baseline

The pre-fix released behavior was introduced by the following runtime commit.
Documentation-only descendants may carry a later source revision and mutable
`latest` digest without changing that Viewer runtime behavior.

- Image digest:
  `sha256:44a909b95e757033b956c0b4b071bd8adc2f404aa2fe6e781fcbe477d7fb6fc8`
- Viewer schema: `26`

- Three.js: package range `^0.185.1`
- Potree runtime: `1.8.2`

The fix is based on documentation commit
`718d7c486b18df1bd2f5a025f02312256de99aaf`, whose runtime is unchanged from
`2d88c70511b01d63bb17e8841c066fb5cb6c6ca7`. Before production verification,
confirm the browser receives a revision containing the fix. The Viewer reads
`x-ltds-viewer-revision` from `/api/v1/health` and stores it in
`VIEWER_BUILD_REVISION`. A stale deployment, stale container, or cached frontend
must still be ruled out.

## Current LOD behavior

### Traversal

The runtime now preserves the manifest's standard `REPLACE` refinement. It no
longer mutates the root to `ADD`.

Current renderer settings:

- `loadAncestors = true`
- `loadSiblings = false`
- `loadAncestorSiblings = false` (LTDS exact-version patch)
- `maxDepth = Infinity`
- download queue maximum: 6 jobs
- parse queue maximum: 2 jobs
- visible, in-frustum, high-error tiles receive queue priority

The application does not manually change cached tile `scene.visible`, tile
active state, tile visible state, or LRU usage.

### Detail mapping

The Detail slider range is `2..24`. Detail maps exponentially to screen-space
error:

```text
errorTarget = 2 * 256 ^ ((24 - detail) / (24 - 2))
```

Examples:

- Detail 24: error target 2
- Detail 13: error target 32
- Detail 2: error target 512

Desktop/default startup uses Detail 13 as both the requested and active detail.
It is a settled requested-detail phase, not an unfinished warmup. Low-memory
clients also remain capped at Detail 13. No higher requested or active Detail is
set until the user moves the slider upward.

### Desktop warmup

A desktop request above Detail 13 starts at Detail 13. The runtime advances by
three Detail units at a time, capped at the request, only when:

1. the current visible frontier satisfies the active error target;
2. the download queue is settled;
3. the parse queue is settled; and
4. the process-node queue is settled.

When the camera is inside a leaf bounding volume, `3d-tiles-renderer` can report
distance zero and infinite screen-space error. A visible terminal tile with
`geometricError: 0` now satisfies the first condition because it cannot refine
further. Infinite error still blocks advancement for a non-terminal or
non-zero-error tile.

Lowering Detail below 13 clears warmup completion. A later increase must stage
through Detail 13 again. This prevents the `24 -> 2 -> 24` slider sequence from
bypassing the warmup.

### Memory profiles

Desktop/default profile:

- minimum retained bytes: `3.25 GiB`
- maximum decoded bytes: `3.5 GiB`
- minimum retained entries: 512
- maximum entries: 1,024
- unload percentage: 20 percent

Clients reporting `navigator.deviceMemory <= 4`:

- maximum Detail: 13
- minimum retained bytes: `640 MiB`
- maximum decoded bytes: `768 MiB`
- minimum retained entries: 256
- maximum entries: 512
- unload percentage: 20 percent

The reduced profile is deliberately honest. It does not claim that Detail 24
will eventually load inside a cache too small for the measured frontier.
Its 768 MiB hard cap is unchanged. The desktop hard cap is intentionally raised
from 3 GiB to the measured 3.5 GiB profile described above. These byte limits
remain the actual memory guards. The higher item ceilings prevent the
renderer's count-based `isFull()` condition
from refusing downloads merely because the visible frontier and retained
`REPLACE` parents contain more than the old entry limits.

### Memory pressure

The runtime samples aggregate LOD state once per second. Starvation is confirmed
only after two consecutive samples where the cache is full, a selected
in-frustum renderable tile is still pending, and renderer work queues cannot
make progress. The first sample gives the renderer's scheduled eviction
microtask a bounded chance to run. Any later one-second sample that is not
simultaneously blocked resets the counter. The second blocked sample makes the
governor restore the last fully settled detail stage
and record the failed detail as a ceiling.

Confirmed starvation also activates a bounded cache-recovery phase. The runtime
temporarily sets only `lruCache.minBytesSize` to zero, allowing the pinned
renderer's normal scheduled eviction to restore admission even when the first
unused tile is larger than the normal floor/cap gap. It restores the configured
floor after the lower active frontier has no pending selected tiles, queues are
idle, and the cache is below its hard cap. The Viewer does not change tile
visibility, active state, cached scene visibility, or LRU membership.

That ceiling prevents automatic recover/starve oscillation: later recovery may
continue at or below the ceiling, but it cannot silently restore a detail level
already shown to starve. `starvedAtDetail` is nullable and must be checked
explicitly rather than passed through `Number()`. Moving the Detail slider is an
explicit new request and clears the ceiling. Starvation counters and ceilings
also reset during tile disposal and loading. The last-settled frontier resets
with the tile lifecycle; a slider increase retains it and a decrease bounds it
to the lower active request. Whenever the governor holds active detail below
the user's request, the status bar reports `memory-limited` instead of
`full-detail`.

## Current camera behavior

The WebODM camera asset was inspected only as a visual reference. No WebODM
GLB, Blender data, or extracted geometry was copied into this repository.

The current marker is independently drawn as three synchronized instanced
meshes:

- orange `#EE5007` camera body
- white tapered frustum
- yellow `#FFA200` forward lens/direction region

Other contracts:

- default fixed world scale: `0.5`
- user range: `0.1..4`
- normal opacity: `0.7`
- representative screen cell: 18 pixels
- maximum visible representatives: 4,000
- fallback pick radius: 12 pixels
- source camera orientation is preserved
- rendered draw indices map back to exact source indices
- Model and Point Cloud use the same geometry
- Model uses lit `MeshStandardMaterial`
- Point Cloud uses unlit `MeshBasicMaterial` because Potree renders custom
  markers in a scene without the point-cloud scene's lights
- Point Cloud hover is source-index based, so a changed representative draw
  slot does not inherit a stale highlight
- camera photos remain permission-gated, indexed, and path-normalized

The latest user message did not say whether camera appearance is still part of
the remaining issue. Confirm that separately instead of assuming it is solved.

## External references and reviews

### WebODM visual reference

The public `OpenDroneMap/WebODM` repository was inspected at commit
`35daffa41768b2ece493367ae62f76739522ccba`. The investigation reviewed
`ModelView.jsx`, the camera model/material arrangement, styling, and license.
The temporary clone was removed after inspection. No upstream camera asset or
extracted vertex data was committed.

### Anthropic Fable 5 advice

Fable 5 was asked for a read-only review of the LOD problem. Its useful advice
was to:

- preserve standard `REPLACE` traversal;
- stop treating a cache increase as a complete solution;
- stage a bounded visible frontier before requesting maximum detail;
- report reduced-memory quality honestly; and
- avoid broad manual renderer-state intervention.

That advice was treated as a hypothesis and checked against the pinned source
and real fixture. A suggestion to set cached `scene.visible = false` was
rejected after source inspection because it could persist through scene reuse.
No external-review credentials, prompts, or raw responses are stored in this
repository.

### Independent release reviews

Independent reviewers found four release blockers during the final iteration:

1. Potree camera markers used a lit material in an unlit scene.
2. Point Cloud camera markers lacked source-mapped hover parity.
3. early diagnostics exposed sanitized tile filenames instead of aggregate
   counts only;
4. the Detail slider could bypass Detail 13 warmup through a
   `24 -> 2 -> 24` sequence.

All four were corrected and covered before release. They remain important
regression checks for future proposals.

## What was changed and tried

### Commit `ea5447fb0ee98faea9a140456bf78341d9b7ac6a`

This earlier attempt added compact camera markers, density decluttering, exact
source-index picking, the 12-pixel fallback, and foreground LOD handling. The
LOD approach retained a transient coarse-root underlay by changing the runtime
root behavior to `ADD` and managing its appearance.

Outcome:

- camera interaction worked;
- the user still reported foreground LOD problems;
- later A/B testing showed coarse root and fine children rendering together,
  which is a direct ghost/mixed-detail mechanism.

### Commit `d32368f24dc3c152a045aeb5f8ce3409668c8c5b`

This attempt:

- raised the desktop cache from 1.75 GiB to 2.75 GiB;
- removed depth/FOV/viewport-dependent camera scaling;
- retained fixed world-space camera matrices;
- added a strict close/far/return fixture regression.

Outcome:

- the strict fixture test passed;
- the user still reported the live LOD view was off;
- the larger cache fixed a proven capacity failure but did not prove that
  capacity was the only live defect.

### Commit `2d88c70511b01d63bb17e8841c066fb5cb6c6ca7`

This release:

- restored standard `REPLACE` traversal;
- removed the transient root underlay and manual tile/LRU state changes;
- added Detail 13 desktop warmup and honest low-memory capping;
- increased measured desktop transition headroom to 3 GiB;
- added aggregate LOD console diagnostics;
- replaced the two-part marker with the current three-part marker;
- reduced the default camera scale to 0.5;
- added Potree hover and corrected Potree's unlit material requirement;
- fixed the Detail-slider warmup bypass.

Outcome:

- all repository and fixture release gates passed;
- the user then reported that the Viewer still has issues;
- therefore the current release remains an investigation baseline, not a
  confirmed live fix.

### Current ground-warmup and starvation fix

The new real-browser reproductions established both causes rather than inferring
them from screenshots:

1. At a ground-level camera pose inside a terminal leaf bounding volume,
   `3d-tiles-renderer` reported distance zero and infinite screen-space error.
   `visibleLodTargetSatisfied()` rejected every non-finite error, so the visible
   zero-error leaf held desktop warmup at Detail 13 of 24 forever.
2. The live model used 38 to 46 visible entries before retained `REPLACE`
   parents were counted. `lruCache.isFull()` therefore tripped the 48-item
   desktop cap or 24-item reduced cap independently of decoded bytes, and used
   tiles could not be evicted to admit the pending downloads.

The fix:

- treats only a visible terminal `geometricError: 0` tile as satisfied at
  infinite screen-space error; coarse or refinable infinite-error tiles still
  block;
- raises item-count floors/caps to 512/1,024 desktop and 256/512 reduced;
- uses the measured 3.25/3.5 GiB desktop byte profile while retaining the
  reduced 640/768 MiB profile and 20-percent eviction setting;
- confirms cache starvation after two consecutive one-hertz blocked samples and
  steps active detail down when possible;
- temporarily relaxes only the soft byte floor so standard LRU eviction can
  restore admission, including at Detail 2, then restores the configured floor
  after the lower frontier settles;
- records `starvedAtDetail` as a ceiling so automatic recovery cannot oscillate
  back into the same starving request;
- clears that ceiling only for an explicit Detail-slider request or tile
  lifecycle reset; and
- reports `memory-limited` whenever the ceiling holds active detail below the
  request.

## Measurements and test evidence

The real local test fixture contains 33 B3DM tiles.

Measured decoded working sets:

- root plus 12 close LOD-0 leaves: `2,482,109,023` bytes, about 2.31 GiB
- sustained all-16-leaf frontier: about `2,713,539,801` bytes, about 2.53 GiB
- measured branch-replacement transition peak: about 2.784 GiB
- current patched-ancestor traversal with 15 LOD-0 leaves and retained parent
  paths: `3,325,605,911` bytes, about 3.10 GiB

The 1.75 GiB cache reproducibly became full and prevented three required leaves
from entering the download queue. The 2.75 GiB and 3 GiB profiles could complete
the older non-ancestor working set. They are not sufficient for the current
patched ancestor-fallback traversal at the sustained all-leaf pose.

The released baseline's sustained test pose is encoded in
`test/lod-browser-acceptance.test.mjs`. The final real fixture regression:

- loaded all required foreground branches;
- detached the coarse root after full replacement coverage;
- moved far enough to drain detailed content;
- returned to the original view; and
- restored all required leaves.

That test completed successfully in about 490 seconds.

Released baseline evidence:

- Node 24 suite: 459 passed, 0 failed, 0 cancelled, 9 expected skips
- real camera/diagnostics browser test: passed
- real 16-leaf close/far/return test: passed
- `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`: zero vulnerabilities
- independent release gate: approved
- container user: `568:568`
- schema 26 verified
- Obj2Tiles 1.6.2 runtime verified
- Potree 1.8.2 EPT/COPC patch verified
- immutable image and release attestation verified

Current candidate evidence is listed near the top of this handoff. It supersedes
the older 37-test/484-test interim counts and the earlier capable-host blocker.
The final Linux Chrome-for-Testing runs include the strengthened small-motion
LRU-retention case, the staged all-16-leaf close/far/return case, and the broader
top-down/root-replacement/camera/diagnostics/tab-lifecycle case.

### Limits of that evidence

The browser reproductions use a local verified fixture and local HTTP transport.
They establish the warmup and item-count failures and exercise the governor, but
do not reproduce every production model, proxy path, GPU, browser, viewport,
network condition, decoded texture footprint, or cache history. Passing local
fixtures cannot confirm a live deployment on a different hierarchy or client.

The final release test also proves eventual convergence, not necessarily that
every intermediate frame looks acceptable to a user. A branch can legally show
an intermediate parent while its replacement leaf parses. The remaining report
may involve transition quality, latency, materials, clipping, stale deployment,
or a different working set rather than the original global-root overlap.

## Approaches rejected or superseded

Do not restore these without new, direct evidence:

1. **Runtime root `REPLACE -> ADD` mutation**
   - It can render a global coarse root with refined descendants.
   - The A/B screenshot test showed a mixed coarse/fine state.

2. **Manual `engineData.scene.visible = false`**
   - Scene visibility can survive cached-scene reuse and create revisit holes.

3. **Manual tile active/visible/LRU manipulation**
   - It bypasses renderer lifecycle assumptions and previously created hard to
     reason about revisit behavior.

4. **Another decoded-byte increase without new working-set evidence**
   - The candidate's 3.5 GiB desktop cap is justified by the measured
     `3,325,605,911`-byte ancestor-retaining frontier. Do not increase it again
     without new live-model measurements.

5. **Copying WebODM's camera asset**
   - WebODM is AGPL-3.0 and the Viewer uses an independently drawn marker.

6. **Potree `MeshStandardMaterial` without lights in the same scene**
   - The marker can render black. Potree markers intentionally use
     `MeshBasicMaterial`.

7. **General CSP `unsafe-eval` or broad external origins**
   - Keep the existing narrow WebAssembly and blob exceptions only.

## Safe runtime diagnostics

The Viewer logs deduplicated snapshots under:

```text
[LTDS LOD]
```

A user or agent can request a snapshot in DevTools:

```javascript
window.__ltds.lodDiagnostics()
```

The snapshot contains only aggregate state:

- phase: `warmup`, `requested-detail`, `reduced-memory`, or `memory-limited`
- requested, active, and maximum Detail
- active error target
- visible root, LOD-1, LOD-0, and other counts
- required, attached, and pending selected-tile and terminal-leaf counts
- download, parse, and process queue activity
- cache used/maximum MiB and byte/item fullness

It intentionally excludes asset URLs, filenames, customer paths, query strings,
credentials, and raw exception objects. It is safe to copy into an issue or an
agent prompt.

At the moment the defect appears, collect:

1. a screenshot;
2. one `lodDiagnostics()` snapshot immediately;
3. another snapshot 15 to 30 seconds later without moving the camera;
4. the selected Detail value;
5. whether the status remains `warming`, `streaming`, `full-detail`,
   `reduced-memory`, or `memory-limited`;
6. browser name/version, viewport, device pixel ratio, and reported
   `navigator.deviceMemory`; and
7. the current Viewer revision from the health response.

Do not paste capability URLs, session URLs, cookies, authorization headers, or
asset request URLs into documentation or agent prompts.

## Remaining verification order

The local diagnosis, Node 24 suite, real B3DM browser cases, dependency audit,
and Docker runtime smoke are complete. Remaining release gates are:

1. obtain an independent approval of the exact final diff;
2. commit and push without overwriting newer `main` work;
3. verify GitHub Actions, the immutable image, `latest`, and release attestation;
4. after deployment, verify the health revision and repeat the affected
   ground/oblique movement sequence; and
5. obtain user confirmation before calling the live issue resolved.

## Remaining production risks

The reproduced root causes are established locally. If the corrected build
still differs in production, investigate these separately rather than undoing
the fixes:

- the live model's decoded replacement frontier exceeds the measured fixture;
- production leaves are too large, causing long main-thread parse stalls;
- a live tileset has different depth, transforms, bounding volumes, or inherited
  refinement than the fixture;
- the visual issue is material alpha/depth behavior rather than traversal;
- actual GPU texture memory exceeds the renderer's decoded-byte accounting;
- a proxy/cache/network problem delays or fails child content or embedded
  textures;
- the live deployment is not running the intended fixed image digest;
- current branch-level parent-to-leaf replacement is correct but visually too
  slow, requiring a deeper tiling hierarchy rather than another renderer hack.

## Guardrails

- Make Viewer changes only in this repository unless separately authorized.
- Do not modify Ops, TrueNAS, production configuration, or client assets as part
  of a diagnosis.
- Do not manually toggle cached scene visibility.
- Do not reintroduce root `ADD` without a real A/B test that proves it does not
  overlap descendants.
- Preserve camera source mapping, photo authorization, fixed world scale,
  density selection, and Point Cloud parity.
- Preserve the pinned full-file EPT LAZ-RS worker and legacy COPC worker split.
- Preserve point budget and compressed-node safety limits.
- Preserve narrow CSP rules. Do not add general `unsafe-eval`.
- Do not claim a release fixed the issue until the user confirms the live view.

## Verification commands

Targeted policy/runtime suites:

```bash
node --test test/lod-policy.test.mjs test/viewer-runtime-wiring.test.js test/lod-materials.test.mjs
```

Full repository suite with the CI Node version:

```bash
NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 npx -y -p node@24 -c 'npm test'
```

Real LOD fixture tests:

```bash
CHROME_PATH=/path/to/chrome \
LTDS_LOD_TEST_TILE_ROOT=/path/to/verified/3d-tiles \
npx -y -p node@24 -c \
  'node --test --test-concurrency=1 test/lod-browser-acceptance.test.mjs'
```

Focused top-down foreground-coverage regression:

```bash
CHROME_PATH=/path/to/chrome \
LTDS_LOD_TEST_TILE_ROOT=/path/to/verified/3d-tiles \
npx -y -p node@24 -c \
  'node --test --test-concurrency=1 --test-name-pattern="hides the coarse root after complete top-down foreground coverage" test/lod-browser-acceptance.test.mjs'
```

Run this browser case on the capable Windows host before merge. Do not run it
concurrently with the full suite: both are memory-intensive and contention can
produce false CDP timeouts. The known snap-Chromium timeout on the current Linux
host occurs unchanged on the baseline and is not sufficient to pass or fail the
fix.

Dependency audit:

```bash
npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high
```

## Acceptance criteria for this fix

The fix is not complete until:

- the ground-level warmup stall is reproduced before the code change and clears
  afterward;
- zero-error terminal leaves satisfy warmup at infinite screen-space error while
  coarse infinite-error tiles still block;
- item caps and byte budgets match the documented desktop and reduced profiles;
- forced starvation steps detail down, remains below its starvation ceiling
  without oscillation, reports `memory-limited`, and resets only on the defined
  lifecycle or manual-slider paths;
- root and refined descendants do not improperly overlap;
- the visible requested frontier eventually settles;
- close, far, pan, and return behavior is verified;
- reduced-memory behavior remains honest and stable;
- Model and Point Cloud camera behavior remains intact;
- targeted tests and the post-final-change Node 24 suite pass;
- the top-down foreground-coverage regression passes on a capable host;
- image checks pass;
- an independent reviewer approves the diff; and
- the user confirms the live Viewer is corrected.
