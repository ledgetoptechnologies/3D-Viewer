# Ground Control Point workflow

Ground control is part of the default-off processing platform. It is available only through an authenticated Viewer administrative session with `viewer.gcp.read` or `viewer.gcp.write`. The public-share and client-session APIs have no dataset, GCP, correspondence, or raw-image routes.

## Canonical representation

- GCP set and point IDs are Viewer-owned stable identifiers.
- Every set belongs to one dataset. Its size-limited original interchange bytes are retained in the private database for auditability. If the same file already exists in the immutable dataset manifest, its ID is associated only after both the filename and SHA-256 match; the manifest is never mutated.
- Canonical horizontal coordinates are WGS84 longitude/latitude (`EPSG:4326`, decimal degrees).
- Canonical elevations and camera altitudes are meters. Ops converts them for imperial-default or metric display without rewriting stored values.
- A correspondence belongs to one processing task and links one GCP point to one image in that task's dataset using non-negative pixel X/Y coordinates.
- Database triggers reject task, GCP, or image combinations from different datasets.

## Generic interchange v1

The API accepts at most 2 MiB and 5,000 points in either of these explicit formats:

### `generic-csv-v1`

UTF-8 RFC-style CSV with the exact header below. `description` is optional; the other columns are required. Unknown columns are rejected so a vendor export cannot be silently misinterpreted.

```csv
point_id,label,latitude,longitude,elevation_m,description
GCP-01,North target,44.500100,-88.100200,243.84,Painted nail
```

### `generic-geojson-v1`

A GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` containing only 3D `Point` features. Coordinates are `[longitude, latitude, elevation_m]`; `properties.point_id` and `properties.label` are required, and `properties.description` is optional.

## Emlid adapter gate

No Emlid column names, coordinate order, height datum, units, or CRS are inferred. A representative Emlid export and its known coordinate interpretation are required before adding a separately versioned Emlid adapter. Until then, export or transform the data to one of the generic formats above.

## Image assistance

Dataset finalization indexes JPEG dimensions, capture time, GPS longitude/latitude, and altitude when those EXIF values exist. Selecting a GCP asks Viewer for up to 200 dataset images ranked by camera-to-GCP great-circle distance. This is only a search suggestion: geographic proximity does not prove that a point is visible in an image. An operator must inspect an image and explicitly save its pixel correspondence.

Raw image bytes flow directly from the Viewer origin to the authenticated Ops browser. They do not pass through the Operations Worker, are sent with private no-store headers, and are never public assets.

## Administrative routes

| Route | Permission | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/datasets/:datasetId/gcp-sets` | `viewer.gcp.read` | List dataset GCP sets |
| `POST /api/v1/datasets/:datasetId/gcp-sets/import` | `viewer.gcp.write` | Parse and import a versioned generic file |
| `GET /api/v1/gcp-sets/:id` | `viewer.gcp.read` | Read canonical points |
| `DELETE /api/v1/gcp-sets/:id` | `viewer.gcp.write` | Remove a set and its marks |
| `PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/gcp-points/:id` | `viewer.gcp.write` | Correct or remove a point |
| `GET /api/v1/datasets/:datasetId/gcp-images` | `viewer.gcp.read` | Read indexed image positions/ranking |
| `GET /api/v1/datasets/:datasetId/gcp-images/:fileId/content` | `viewer.gcp.read` | Stream one private source image |
| `GET/POST /api/v1/tasks/:taskId/gcp-correspondences` | `viewer.gcp.read` / `viewer.gcp.write` | List or save task marks |
| `PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/gcp-correspondences/:id` | `viewer.gcp.write` | Correct or remove a mark |

Every mutation requires `Idempotency-Key` and uses the same session-bound replay/conflict behavior as the processing control plane.
